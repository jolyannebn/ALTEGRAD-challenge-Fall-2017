The given work is composed of one PDF file and 5 Jupyter Notebooks :
Each notebook shows the work done for a different approach (Graph, deep, classical machine learning, ...).
Through the reading of the PDF file, we will point out at different moment the different work done in the notebooks.

There is a notebook called Feature Extraction, the purpose of this notebook is to generate the featured data once
and save it in a csv file, so that we can just read from it. We do this because the generation part is quite long.
The generated CSV files by this notebook will be called X_train_processed.csv, y_train_processed.csv and X_test_processed.csv
They need to be placed in the directory data :
data/X_train_processed.csv
